I finally started my first post in my personal website :raised_hands: . And I want to keep doing three of main things daily. 
The first is searching and reading the top 10 critical tech news and articles in the early morning before starting any other studying.
And the second is reading a book excepts for textbooks to deepen my interest.
The last but not the least, type a topic article monthly and I have to do progressment everyday on this personal website. I aim for inspire myself and train my skills of expression and coding.

Additionally, I want to recommend a book:orange_book: which is called [startwithwhy](https://startwithwhy.com/).  An inspiring book which is edited by Simon Sinek,telling the priority of our decision should come from *"why"*
