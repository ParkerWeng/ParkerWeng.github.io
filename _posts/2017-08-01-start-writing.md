As you know, AI, big data and blockchain already became the main trends in these years. We all know or hear these literal meanings but without understanding. The news today indicates the influence concretely. I strongly recommend the Blockchian one which explains precisely and also easy to understand. 

These topics are already from good-to-know to vital to our lives and careers, especially for people like me work in field of finance.
