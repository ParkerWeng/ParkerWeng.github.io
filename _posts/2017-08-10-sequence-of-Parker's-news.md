This time the news focused partly on bitcoin relating topics. The first is that ICO is developing too much at least right now and US started to regulate and interfere this field. It’s a positive decision for long-turn in my opinion. Overheating can cause side effect for the future of bitcoin. Besides, there is a new branch for bitcoin and its name is bitcoin cash. It is design for quicken the speed of bitcoin transaction but there’re still too many defects now, so we should keep observing. 

The other notable news is the Chinese one relating to interference to mobile payment by Chinese government. This event showed that even you’re as strong as Ali and Tencent you still have to listen to Chinese government. It’s always the problem investors are worry about in this market. However, I think the rule and intention are clear and obvious. We just see the development after this.
